    <h1>What's New in CotEditor 2.2</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Available in the Mac App Store</dt>
      <dd>
        CotEditor 2.2 is released on the Mac App Store. The system-integrated
        version management makes easier keeping your CotEditor up to date. You
        can also continuously get a non-AppStore version to manage it with Cask
        or something.
      </dd>

      <dt>Sandboxing</dt>
      <dd>
        As the App Sandbox guarantees the prohibition of malicious behaviors at
        the system level, CotEditor became a more reliable OS X application than
        ever before. The non-AppStore version is also sandboxed.
      </dd>

      <dt>Improvements for the vertical text orientation</dt>
      <dd>
        Printing document in the vertical orientation, displaying line number
        also on the vertical text mode, or even saving the text orientation
        state in the document file. Now you can more comfortably edit your text
        in the vertical orientation.
      </dd>

      <dt>Faster syntax highlighting</dt>
      <dd>The syntax highlighting becomes further faster and more nicely.</dd>

      <dt>Print feature improvement</dt>
      <dd>
        Other than the vertical text print, the print feature has been improved,
        for instance, to change page settings in the print panel, to store
        CotEditor's own print settings to the system print preset.
      </dd>

      <dt>El Capitan support</dt>
      <dd>CotEditor 2.2.0 works well on OS X El Capitan.</dd>
