    <h1>What is the difference between the four kinds of Shift JIS?</h1>

    <p>
      The four kinds of Shift JIS are different from each other as described
      below:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Shift JIS</th>
        <td>
          The most basic Shift JIS supporting JIS level 1 and 2 kanji
          characters.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Mac OS</th>
        <td>
          Based on Shift JIS, with extended support for such as Mac-dependent
          characters. Being used in Mac OS 9 and earlier.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Windows, DOS</th>
        <td>
          Based on Shift JIS, with extended support for such as
          Windows-dependent characters.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Shift JIS X0213</th>
        <td>
          Support JIS X0213 character set, which includes JIS level 1 through 4
          kanji characters.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Though choosing an appropriate encoding varies from case to case, it is
      normally safer to use Japanese (Shift JIS). However, note that there are
      differences between these encodings in the way of dealing with particular
      characters as below:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <th>Halfwidth Yen sign (&#x00A5;)</th>
          <th>Halfwidth backslash (&#x005C;)</th>
          <th>Halfwidth tilde (&#x007E;)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Shift JIS</th>
          <td>Available</td>
          <td>Replaced with fullwidth backslash</td>
          <td>Not available</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Mac OS</th>
          <td>Available</td>
          <td>Available</td>
          <td>Available</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Windows, DOS</th>
          <td>Replaced with halfwidth backslash</td>
          <td>Available</td>
          <td>Available</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Shift JIS X0213</th>
          <td>Available</td>
          <td>Replaced with fullwidth backslash</td>
          <td>Replaced with fullwidth tilde</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
