    <h1>What's New in CotEditor 2.4</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Improve text finder</dt>
      <dd>
        CotEditor re-implemented text find actions by own code. More
        sophisticated and integrated UI makes your text search process much more
        intuitive.
      </dd>

      <dt>Brackets and quotes balancing</dt>
      <dd>
        For instance, typing <code>{</code> inserts the corresponding
        <code>}</code> then moves the cursor into the brackets automatically.
        The feature helps reduce bothering cursor movement and contributes to
        your smart coding.
      </dd>

      <dt>Clickable URL links in documents</dt>
      <dd>
        This new option detects URL strings in your documents and provides them
        as clickable &amp; quick-lookable links.
      </dd>

      <dt>Better detection on the file opening</dt>
      <dd>
        We reviewed the previous file detection code and improved the precision
        of the encoding detection. Furthermore, CotEditor 2.4 alerts about a
        file that isn't obviously a text file in order to avoid unwanted
        hang-up.
