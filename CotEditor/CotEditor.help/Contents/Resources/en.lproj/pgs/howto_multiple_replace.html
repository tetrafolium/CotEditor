    <h1>Replacing with multiple rules</h1>

    <p>
      Using <dfn>Multiple Replacement</dfn> feature, you can process multiple
      text replacements at once in succession. The replacement rules can be
      stored as a named preset and reused when you need.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Multiple Replace window</h2>

      <p>
        You can open the Multiple Replace window to manage and process the
        multiple replacement in your document.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Choose Find &gt; Multiple Replace (from the CotEditor menu at the top
          of your screen).
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Manage replacement definitions</h2>

      <p>
        The stored replacement definitions that you created before are listed in
        the list on the left.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Click the Add button + at the bottom of the list to create a new
          replacement definition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click the Remove button - at the bottom of the list to delete the
          replacement definition that is selected in the list.
        </li>
        <li>Click again the selected definition in the list to rename it.</li>
        <li>
          Click the Advanced button with a gear symbol for further operations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>Export/import replacement definitions</h3>

        <p>
          You can export your replacement definitions to transfer them to
          another computer. Each replacement definition becomes a single
          <dfn>CotEditor replacement definition</dfn> file, which has a
          “.cotrpl” file extension and of which content is written in JSON
          format.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Export</b>: Select a definition to export in the list on the
            left, then select “Export” menu item in the Advanced menu at the
            bottom of the list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Import</b>: Drop replacement definition files to the list on the
            left. Alternatively, select “Import” menu item in the Advanced menu,
            then select the replacement definition files to import.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Process multiple replacement</h2>

      <p>
        The definition selected in the list on the left is shown in the editor
        area on the right side. The replacement rules in the editor area will be
        performed row by row from top to bottom at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use the buttons at the bottom of the editor area to perform the multiple
        replacement.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Replace All</b>: Perform the replacement for the frontmost
          document.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Highlight</b>: Highlight all matches in the frontmost document*.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        * Beware that the matches by the “Highlight” command can be different
        from the replacement targets when you perform actual “Replace All,”
        because, on the Replace All, the succeeding rows are applied to the
        document that the previous rows above have already been applied to.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Edit replacement definition</h2>

      <p>
        You can create your own replacement definitions to process a multiple
        replacement.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Create new replacement definition</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Click the Add button + at the bottom of the list on the left side to
            create a new replacement definition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the Add button + in the editor area on the right side to
            create a new replacement rule.
          </li>
          <li>Input your desired replacement rule to the added row.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          You don’t need to perform save after the modification because your
          changes will be saved automatically immediately during the edit.
        </p>

        <p>
          A row with an invalid replacement rule will just be skipped when the
          replacement is performed.
        </p>
