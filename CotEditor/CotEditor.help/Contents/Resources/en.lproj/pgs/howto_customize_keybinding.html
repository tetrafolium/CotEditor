    <h1>Customizing key bindings</h1>

    <p>
      You can fully customize CotEditor's menu key bindings. Also, you can store
      text snippets which have your preferred key bindings assigned. By default,
      you can insert “<code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>” (with a line ending) by
      pressing Shift-Return. Go to “Key Binbings” pane in the preferences to
      create your own key bindings.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Menu Key Bindings must include Command key.</li>
      <li>Snipett Key Bindings must exclude Command key.</li>
      <li>
        You cannot set the key bindings that are already taken (e.g. shortcuts
        for your script files or menu items that don't appear in the Menu Key
        Bindings list).
