    <h1>What's New in CotEditor 3.4</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Apply multiple replacement rules at once</dt>
      <dd>
        Using the new feature called “Multiple Replacement”, you can batch
        process text replacement with a preset definition containing multiple
        replacement rules. Those definitions can also be saved to reuse later.
      </dd>

      <dt>Document outilne at a glance</dt>
      <dd>
        Now, you can look over the auto-extracted document outline, which you
        might see in the navigation bar above the editor, in the sidebar
        inspector.
      </dd>

      <dt>Much easier regular expression pattern editing in find panel</dt>
      <dd>
        The new input fields in the find panel syntax-highlight their contents
        when the regular expression option is enabled. In addition, the input
        fields also recognize and handle brace pairs properly just like the main
        document editor does.
