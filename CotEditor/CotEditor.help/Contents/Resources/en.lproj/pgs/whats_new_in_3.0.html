    <h1>What's New in CotEditor 3.0</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Swift migration</dt>
      <dd>
        All of the source codes for CotEditor was completely rewritten in Swift
        from Objective-C.
      </dd>

      <dt>Tabbed window</dt>
      <dd>
        Finally, CotEditor now supports tabbing windows on Sierra. On CotEditor
        3.0, the tab behavior was improved from the standard Sierra
        implementation in order to let it behave more naturally.
      </dd>

      <dt>Brushed-up look</dt>
      <dd>
        Graphic images like toolbar icons and application icon were also updated
        to get a more modern look.
      </dd>

      <dt>New text search engine</dt>
      <dd>
        The find panel's regular expression engine was changed from Onigmo
        (Oniguruma-mod) to the ICU library. Thanks to that, the line-up of text
        search is updated with new useful items and not only for the regex
        search but also for the normal texture search.
      </dd>

      <dt>Support macOS Sierra</dt>
      <dd>
        Hello to Sierra and good-bye to Mountain Lion and Mavericks. So,
        CotEditor now supports from OS X 10.10 to macOS 10.12.
      </dd>
