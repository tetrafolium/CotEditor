    <h1>What's New in CotEditor 3.3</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Handle documents on launch in more intelligent way</dt>
      <dd>
        We improved various behaviors regarding document handling on launch for
        letting you start working with your documents more and more right away.
      </dd>

      <dt>Sort lines as you desire</dt>
      <dd>
        New “Sort by pattern” enables you to sort selected lines by specific
        column or fully freely using the regular expression. Of course, through
        a neat user interface.
      </dd>

      <dt>iCloud document (finally)</dt>
      <dd>
        We know it's kind of too late, but CotEditor now supports the iCloud
        document, so that CotEditor has a own space on iCloud, moves files to
        there easier, and can resolve a file modification conflict visually.
      </dd>

      <dt>Improvement on the Share featue</dt>
      <dd>Document sharing in CotEditor gets more feature.</dd>

      <dt>More macOS native look &amp; feel</dt>
      <dd>
        Added small tweaks to the user interface. You don't see any different?
        Then, that's good. It means it worked.
      </dd>

      <dt>More international</dt>
      <dd>
        CotEditor now supports the RTL (right-to-left) writing direction for
        such as Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi and others. Furthermore, Portuguese
        localization is newly added.
      </dd>
