    <h1>Specification Changes on CotEditor 2.2</h1>

    <p>
      CotEditor has been Sandboxed since version 2.2.0. It includes some
      specification changes from the previous versions in order to conform to
      the Sandbox and the Mac App Store rules. If you've used the legacy version
      before, you may need some manual migrations.
    </p>

    <h2>User Settings Location</h2>
    <p>
      The location of the general CotEditor settings moved from
      <code>~/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/</code> to
      <code
        >~/Library/Containers/com.coteditor.CotEditor/Data/Library/Application
        Support/CotEditor/</code
      >. This migration will be automatically done on the first launch of
      CotEditor 2.2.0.
    </p>

    <h2>Scripts Folder Location</h2>
    <p>
      The location of the scripts folder moved from
      <code>~/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/ScriptMenu/</code> to
      <code>~/Library/Application Scripts/com.coteditor.CotEditor/</code>.
      <strong
        >Users need to migrate their script to the new folder manually</strong
      >, since CotEditor doesn't have the write permission to the new location.
    </p>

    <h2><code>cot</code> Command-Line Tool</h2>
    <p>
      From CotEditor 2.2.0, the <code>cot</code> command-line tool is no more
      bundled to CotEditor.app but provided separately on our web site. Download
      the new one from
      <a href="http://coteditor.com/cot">http://coteditor.com/cot</a> and
      isntall it manually. The old one is not compatible with CotEditor 2.2.0.
