    <h1>Specification Changes on CotEditor 2.0</h1>

    <p>
      CotEditor 2.0 includes some specification changes for customization from
      the previous versions. If you've used the legacy version before, you may
      need some manual migrations.
    </p>

    <h2>Syntax Style Format</h2>
    <p>
      The format for syntax style definition has been changed significantly. The
      user customized styles will be translated automatically to the new style
      format on the first launch of CotEditor 2. However, we recommend to update
      or rewrite your styles to conform to the new features for syntax style
      like the comment-out toggling or new highlighting variations.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find some new additional syntax styles on our
      <a
        href="https://github.com/coteditor/CotEditor/wiki/Additional-Syntax-Styles"
        rel="external"
        >Wiki page</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Regular Expression Engine for Outline Extracting</h2>
    <p>
      Those who have customized syntax styles in CotEditor 1.x may have to fix
      their definition to extract outline menu manually, because the regular
      expression engine for outline parsing has been changed in 2.0 from
      Oniguruma to ICU library. Validate your customized syntax styles in syntax
      style editor and follow the messages.
    </p>

    <p>The typical points to fix are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The “<code>{</code>” and “<code>}</code>” as character must always be
        escaped with backslash “<code>\</code>” in ICU, however not in
        Oniguruma.
      </li>
      <li>
        The definition of “<code>$&amp;</code>” for the whole matched string was
        removed in 2.0. Use “<code>$0</code>” instead to get the same effect.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      See
      <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp" rel="external"
        >Regular Expressions - ICU User Guide</a
      >
      for all regex syntax.
    </p>

    <h2>API for AppleScript</h2>
    <p>
      Some specifications for scripting support have been updated on CotEditor
      2.0. From this, some user scripts may not run correctly on 2.0 without
      modifying. See “Scripting with AppleScript” document in “Help” menu for
      details of this specification change.
    </p>

    <h2>Bundle Identifier</h2>
    <p>
      The bundle identifier for CotEditor was changed from
      “com.aynimac.CotEditor” to “com.coteditor.CotEditor”. From this change,
      file mappings or other links to CotEditor (e.g. external editor) outside
      CotEditor can be reset. Please link them again, if links are lost.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>For advanced users</em>: Notice that the file names for preferences
      and the domain name for “<code>defaults</code>” command in Terminal was
      also changed.
    </p>
