    <h1>Discover CotEditor</h1>

    <p>
      CotEditor is a Cocoa text editor designed for editing plain text files
      such as web pages (HTML), program source codes (Python, Ruby, etc.), or
      TeX sources. CotEditor offers a lot of useful features that are not
      available in macOS's TextEdit. You'll find some of them below.
    </p>

      <h2>Powerful find and replace</h2>

        />CotEditor has a very powerful find and replace feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the support for regular expression search, you can
        display a list of search results, or highlight matched words in your
        document.

        />CotEditor colorizes particular strings such as reserved words of
        programming languages, TeX commands, and HTML elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coloring rules for major programming languages are built in by default.
        Furthermore, you can add or customize styles as you like. You can also
        define the strings to be colored by regular expression patterns, not
        only by words.

        document and displays them in a drop-down menu. By clicking on a listed
        item, you can go directly to the corresponding part of your document.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can set what items should appear and how they should be titled in
        the menu by customizing the corresponding syntax style.

        reserved words of programming languages or HTML elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you press the ESC or F5 key after typing the first few letters of a
        word, a list of possible completions shows up. You only need to select
        the one you want to input from the list. The range of completions can be
        expanded or limited.
