    <h1>Customizing syntax coloring rules</h1>

    <p>Syntax coloring rules are determined by the following settings:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>RE</th>
        <td>
          If this option is selected, both Begin-string and End-string will be
          considered as regular expressions (RE stands for Regular Expression).
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>IC</th>
        <td>
          If this option is selected, case will be ignored during the search (IC
          stands for Ignore Case). For example, if you set “abc” as Begin-string
          and check IC, “ABC” or “abc” or “Abc” in your document will be
          matched.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Begin String</th>
        <td>
          A string which denotes the beginning of the search pattern. This is
          required in order to search the code elements you want to be colored.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>End String</th>
        <td>
          A string which denotes the end of the search pattern. This can be left
          blank.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Description</th>
        <td>
          You can use this field to leave a comment about the term. Description
          doesn't affect to syntax highlighitng. This can be left blank.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <ul>
      <li>A definition whose Begin-string is blank will be ignored.</li>
      <li>
        A definition whose End-string is blank and RE is turned off will be used
        for defining the completion list as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        The RE setting affects both Begin-string and End-string, which means
        they should be written in regular expression or plain form both
        together.
      </li>
    </ul>
