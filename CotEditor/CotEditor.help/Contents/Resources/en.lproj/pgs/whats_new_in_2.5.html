    <h1>What's New in CotEditor 2.5</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>New “Unicode (UTF-8) with BOM” encoding</dt>
      <dd>
        No more suffering by the invisible UTF-8 BOM. Now, you can check from
        the toolbar whether your UTF-8 document has a BOM, and even switch
        between with and without it easily.
      </dd>

      <dt>Adding the execute permission from save panel</dt>
      <dd>
        As you can give the execute permission on the save panel, scripts can be
        run immediately after the creation without <code>chmod</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Smoother pinch-zoom</dt>
      <dd>
        The pinch-zoom becomes smoother and more intelligent. For instance, how
        about splitting editors and scale up just one side from them?
