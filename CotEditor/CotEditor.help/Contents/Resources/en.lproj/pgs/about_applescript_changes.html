<section>
<h3>Discontinuation of <code>path</code> property</h3>
<p>The <code>path</code> property of ‘document’ object is discontinued on the modern AppleScript’s Standard Suite for a long time. Since CotEditor adopted it on version 2.0, this property is also deprecated on CotEditor.  Use new <code>file</code> property instead.  While <code>path</code> property returns a text object, <code>file</code> property returns a file object.</p>
<p>For backwards compatibility, CotEditor 2.0 added a hidden <code>path</code> property to ‘document’ object uniquely, however do not use it if you create new scripts and we also recommend to migrate your previous scripts to use <code>file</code> property. Because this `path` property can be removed some day in the future without announce.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Update of internal code for <code>range</code> property</h3>
<p>The internal code for <code>range</code> property of text selection object to identify itself has been changed on CotEditor 2.0.  The key for the range property is still <code>range</code>, so you don’t need to care about this if you write a new script. However <strong>compiled</strong> AppleScripts (.scpt) which were written previously might need some update for this change.</p>

<h4>How to fix:</h4>
<p>Open your .scpt files on AppleScript Editor (or Script Editor), the words that was <code>range</code> previously might be changed to <code>«class prng»</code> or something like that. Overwrite them with <code>range</code> again. And save them.<br/>
This issue doesn’t occur with plain-text AppleScript (.applescript). </p>

<h2>Terminology change on CotEditor 1.5.0</h2>
<section>
<h3>Window transparency</h3>
<p>According to the changing of the mechanism to make window transparent on CotEditor 1.5, the terms about window opacity for AppleScripting was also changed. The <b>document</b>'s properties till on version 1.4:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">
	<li><code>transparency</code>: The transparency of Window or TextView. (real, from ‘0.2’ to ‘1.0’)</li>
	<li><code>alpha only textView</code>: Whether the transparency setting affects only the TextView or not. (boolean)</li>
</ul>

<p>were deprecated, and the new <b>window</b>'s property:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">
	<li><code>view opacity</code>: The opacity of the view. (real, from ‘0.2’ to ‘1.0’)</li>
</ul>

<p>was added instead.</p>

<p>Since the previous term “transparency” was incorrectly used until version 1.4, the property name was renamed from “transparency” to “opacity” but the value to set is not changed. Namely, 1.0 means fully opaque on both properties.</p>
<p>Please note that <strong>there is no backward compatibility</strong> with this changing.</p>

<h3>Selection Object direct under the Application</h3>
<p>In version 0.6, the initial release of CotEditor, if you didn't specify the ‘selection’ object, the frontmost window's contents will be selected. But it was actually didn't work correctly and therefore deprecated.  This method was kept valid however to maintain backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>On CotEditor 1.5, it is formally removed.  Specify the target like below, when you get the ‘selection’ object.</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>example 1.</figcaption>
<pre class="source"><code class="AppleScript">tell application "CotEditor"
	contents of selection <b>of front document</b>
end tell
</code></pre>
</figure>

<figure>
<figcaption>example 2.</figcaption>
<pre class="source"><code class="AppleScript">tell application "CotEditor"
	<b>tell document 1</b>
		contents of selection
	<b>end tell</b>
end tell
</code></pre>
