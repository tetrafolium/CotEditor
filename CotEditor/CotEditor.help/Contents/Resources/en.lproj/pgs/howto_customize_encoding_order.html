    <h1>Setting the priority of encoding detection</h1>

    <p>To change the priority of encoding detection on file opening:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose CotEditor &gt; Preferences.</li>
      <li>Select the Format pane.</li>
      <li>
        In the “priority of encodings” section, click the “Edit List” button.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move up the encodings you use frequently.<br />
        (Here, we recommend placing UTF-16 <strong>after</strong> other
        often-used encodings, as UTF-16 can encode most characters.)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Though you can change the order of encodings, you cannot delete them. Just
      move down the encodings you don't use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, “Unicode (UTF-8)” and “Unicode (UTF-8) with BOM” are always
      handled as a set. Because the BOM (byte order mark) will be taken into
      account when trying encoding data into UTF-8, there is no effect on the
      detection precision that the order of these two encodings are fixed.
